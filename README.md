# Mahjong

There are plenty of Mahjong Solitaire games on the market, but there are very few decent Japanese Mahjong games on the Western market. This project is an attempt to recreate classic Japanese Mahjong for Western audiences with available Japanese localization.

This project is current in development alongside the [Cascade Framework](https://github.com/Shirasho/CascadeFramework). Gaps in development may occur.
